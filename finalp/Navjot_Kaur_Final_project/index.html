			<p>My name is Navjot Kaur. I have a great keen to work in a big company 
				and management and in term 1, I started enhancing my knowledge regarding 
				Canadian companies, their rules, regulations, and working style. I did 
				make some mistakes at some points when I was assigned new tasks by instructors 
				and learned from them as well. I gained knowledge regarding machine learning, 
				database, communication, programming, and the importance of showing your 
				willpower and expressing your viewpoint. Moreover, your attitude and expression 
				matter the most in teamwork.
				I studied business in the 12th grade and looking for work as a Business analyst 
				in an IT company. I want my employer to be supportive and professional and help 
				in the growth and development of employees and the company. As both employee and 
				company growth are important to run a successful business. When I am working on 
				something new for me, I need guidance, training, and support and at this point, 
				I can work in a team.</p>
